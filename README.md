How I studied for and passed the AWS Solutions Architect Professional Exam

# Section 1. ACloudGuru Course

I took the following acloudguru course. This is a great overview of all the material covered in the exam. Allow me to reiterate, this is an OVERVIEW. It is, in no way, comprehensive of everything needed to pass this exam. I still highly recommend starting with this as it is a great guide to give you a sense of the exam.

# Section 2. Re:Invent Videos
I watched the following re:invent videos. Yes, the list is long. I believe this covers 
I suggest watching them at 1.5x the speed. I found that 1.5x is fast enough to help get through the videos quickly yet slow enough to be able to comprehend the material.

# Section 3. Whitepapers

These are to all the whitepapers I read, took notes of and reviewed close to the exam.
It is tough to actually read all of these as it is a lot of material. You may skim through them but you must be really attentive/focused as you do so. There is a lot of little details in these whitepapers; details that are crucial to passing the exam.

# Section 4. How to approach the exam

I went through this amazing, short, FREE course created by AWS:

https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=34737

This course assumes that you have strong knowledge of the exam material. This course DOES NOT cover exam material. Instead, this course is about how to approach the different questions in the exam. It breaks down the thought process of those who answer these very challenging questions correctly. I highly recommend going through this course after you have gone through the above mentioned videos and whitepapers.
